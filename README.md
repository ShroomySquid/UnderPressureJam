# Under Pressure Game Jam

So here's the idea i'll be working with:

Top-down isometric game where you play as scientist who try to keep a nuclear power plant from exploding during a zombie apocalypse.

Visual && music: halloween theme in mind + zombie apocalypse + tchernobyl/eatern europe

Turn base in mind, but could make it real time. More stealth orientated, but with combat possible.

The team will have to naviguate the powerplant to repair/check different section to make sure it doesn't blow. The map will be fill with zombies that react on sound/sight and try to kill the team.
Could implement abnormal zombies (ones that breaks stuff, ones that ignore your team, zombies with special abilities, etc.)
Could implement different characters who have special ability (military man start with a gun, scientist repair faster, soccer player move more each turn, etc.)

If one of the nuclear plant component failed or all of the team is dead, the player lose.

1 hardcoded level to make sure the game is finished by tuesday (no random generation) && to experiment with level design.
Could implement extra levels.
Could implement broken systems in powerplant make noise which attracks zombies.
Could implement puzzle to solve for broken systems.
Could implement trap system the player could build to lure zombies.
